# AIxTech crypto intel v0.59: paper-only trading information system

Research harness for automated cryptocurrency **information** and paper strategy evaluation. Does not place live orders, does not store exchange secrets, and is not financial advice.

Builds on [zeekiankok92/aixtech-agent-harness-demo](https://github.com/zeekiankok92/aixtech-agent-harness-demo) secure AI-agent practices and prior kkzee92 versions (up to v0.58).

## Enhancements in v0.59

- Refined multi-factor strategies per asset class: adaptive EMA/ATR/Supertrend/Ichimoku/BB/Keltner/VWAP/MACD/Stochastic/Heikin-Ashi/Parabolic SAR/Donchian/GARCH-style + EWMA vol forecast proxies, Fibonacci, Elliott wave proxy, options skew/gamma/vanna, funding-rate dynamics, expanded on-chain (volume-flow, active-address, whale, smart-money, exchange inflow/outflow, netflow, OI change, liquidation heat, order-flow imbalance, liquidity depth, MVRV, SOPR, realized-cap, exchange reserve change, NVTS proxy), DEX LP depth + IL, volatility clustering + ATR percentile + realized vol forecast, multi-horizon consistency, RSI/MACD/Stoch/Heikin/CCI/Williams %R divergence, regime clustering simulation (k-means + HMM-style + GMM proxy + transition probability + LOF), volume profile/delta, relative strength z-score, adaptive Kelly-like + risk-parity + CVaR research sizing, synthetic social volume proxy.
- Portfolio-level adaptive correlation matrix + isolation risk gate with dynamic vol-scaled, forecast-adjusted, risk-parity, and CVaR proxy sizing under high vol/anomaly/correlation/isolation/cluster regimes.
- Strengthened zero-trust cyber/data security architecture: expanded redaction (BIP39, WIF, PEM, AWS, GitHub PATs, high-entropy, Solana, session tokens, hardware wallet exports, partial seeds, quantum mentions, exchange API key patterns including Binance/Bybit/OKX/KuCoin/Gate formats, JWT, private key hex, Telegram/Discord bot tokens, more base58/hex variants, seed checksums, exchange-specific key formats, hardware serials, API secret fragments, ChaCha20 key mentions, SSH private keys), sealed multi-hash lineage (SHA-256 + SHA3-256 + BLAKE2b + SHA512 + SHA3-512 + BLAKE3 proxy + SHA3-384 + SHAKE128 proxy), entropy scoring, isolation forest-style + LOF + autoencoder residual + one-class SVM proxy anomaly, residency stamps, consecutive-action counters, source attestation, continuous verification proxies, PDPA-style tripwire, feed integrity checks, Merkle-style subtree seals with monotonic counter, quantum-safe hash mentions, continuous attestation.
- Nine asset classes with refined playbooks, risk caps, class-specific cost models, confidence floors, and adaptive horizon.
- Research only; synthetic fixtures recommended. AI-agent harness friendly with CI gates (lint, tests, secret scan style).

See [docs/asset-class-strategies.md](docs/asset-class-strategies.md) and [docs/security-architecture.md](docs/security-architecture.md).

## What it does

- Classifies into nine asset classes with enhanced multi-factor research rules.
- Labels regime (trend/range/stress) + volatility tier + forecast + anomaly score + correlation regime + cluster + isolation + relative strength + risk parity + CVaR proxy + fib/elliott/options/on-chain advanced.
- Scores signal then multi-gate risk (class caps, confidence, correlation, anomaly, isolation, drawdown, kill switch, vol scaling + forecast + risk-parity + CVaR).
- Paper fills with class costs; hash-chained audit with multi-hash sealed lineage.
- No live execution, no secret storage.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=src python -m crypto_intel.demo
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q
```

## Controls

Paper-only mode guard. No trade keys. Class caps, confidence floors, kill switch, drawdown, correlation, anomaly, isolation gates. Hash-chained audit + sealed multi-hash lineage. Expanded redaction. PDPA-style tripwire. gitleaks and lint in CI recommended.

## Honesty

No live connector included. Strategy scores describe synthetic data. Not financial, legal, or compliance advice. Research only.
